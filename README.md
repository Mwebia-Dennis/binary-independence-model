# binary-independence-model
a notebook and python code aimed at demonstrating information retrieval using binary independence model
## example usage
implementing this code is as easy as importing the BIMModel class, then search the query, with the limit of documents you want to retrieve

- from model import BIMModel

- bim_model = BIMModel()
- bim_model.search_query("secondary emission of electrons by positive ion bombardment of the cathode", 10)

## how to run code
### python ( .py files ) codes
* unzip the dataset (HW04 FILE)
* Install all necessary packages
* create python file and implement the BIMModel.search_query(search_query, N_retrieved_docs)


### notebook
* take a small course on how to use jupyter notebook/google colab
